# **React Web App Project - Implementing a Developer Survey**

This project is part of the training course of professor Rodrigo Manguinho (Mango) at Udemy.

The objective of the training is to show how to create a system in ReactJs using the new Hooks, Recoil, with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as the working methodology, Clean Architecture to make the distribution of responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS, and applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
